This is my Car Search Aggregator/Sorter program, built on the Eclipse IDE (java) environment. It collects data from listings specified by the user (keyword/model of car) from Australian sites such as Carsales, Ebay and Gumtree.

This program can currently collect the name, image, link and price (including conversion to double type to sort listings) from all listings that the user specifies (eg. "holden sv6). They can also specify how many pages the program will process (number of items to be included in search), location, sort method and whether to include buyitnow or auction listings. 

You many use and modify this program in any way. This program requires a lot of optimisation and maintenance (everything is in main, no functions, no database, URL and HTML dependent). I am a 1st year undergrad so dont expect this code to be perfect!
